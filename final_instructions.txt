These are the final instructions for setting up you LEMP stack. 
1. Edit the /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf file to have user and group equal nginx instead of apache. 
2. In the same file, change the listen directive to /var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock.
3. In the same file, chnage the listen.owner and listen.group to nginx and uncomment listen.mode. 
4. Run 'sudo systemctl restart php'
5. In the /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf file, change the server_name to your IP address.
6. In the same file, change the fastcgi_pass unix to be fastcgi_pass unix /var/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock"
7. Test that the system works with the command 'nginx -t'
8. Run 'sudo systemctl restart nginx'
9. Run 'sudo chown -R admin.wheel /usr/share/nginx/html'
10. Run 'sudo mysql_secure_installation' and set a root password. Press enter for default values. 
11. Now you can make php files in /usr/share/nginx/html/. Test this by navigating in a browser to the correct page.
