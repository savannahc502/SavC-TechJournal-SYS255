"""
To display a "thank you" message after the form has been submitted, you can achieve this within the process_form.php file, which will handle the form submission and process the input data. Here's an example of how you can do it:
- Create a new file named process_form.php.
- Inside process_form.php, you can use PHP to process the form data and then display a "thank you" message.
